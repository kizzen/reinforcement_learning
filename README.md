# Teaching a Computer to Play Tic Tac Toe using the Q-Learning Algorithm

I taught a computer how to play tic tac toe by implementing the Q-learning algorithm from scratch (`import pandas`). I then developed a game where you can play tic tac toe vs the computer or another human. The game is played from the Terminal (`python tic_tac_toe.py`).

For more info on the the project, check out my blog post: http://kizzen.io/rl (or the notebook in this repo: tic_tac_toe.ipynb)
